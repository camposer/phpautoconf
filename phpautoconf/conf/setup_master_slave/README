This config package intends to automate the start setup of a 
1 master 2 slaves mysql configuration.

For this example to run, I've installed 3 mysql instances into my machine
using MySQL Sandbox, see: http://mysqlsandbox.net/

To run it, just type: $PHPAUTOCONF_DIR/run setup_master_slave

You must be sure that this config package is into the conf dir with the
setup_master_slave name
